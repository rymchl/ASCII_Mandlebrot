Mandlebrot zoom composed by characters displayed on your unix terminal (Written on OSX in C++)

compile with "g++ main.cpp -o mandle" 
run with "./mandle (x-coordinarte) (y coordinate)" ex "./mandle 0 -1.234"
end program with "crtl c"

Takes two commandline inputs (x and y on complex plane)
scales with terminal size (larger window = more detail = slower computation)
heres some interesting points to try out
